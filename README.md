# Raytracer in C

To build this repository, you would need to have at least Cmake 3.23 and [Check](https://libcheck.github.io).

If you're on FreeBSD like me, I don't know why Cmake cannot find libcheck when installed using ports package. Instead, you can use [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) and compile it from source.
